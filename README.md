# Automated-dino-game-using-Arduino
 To make this automated dino game I am using Arduino UNO you can also use Arduino nano, let's see how to make Automated Dino Game using Arduino.
 we need Arduino Uno Servo Motor 10K Resistor and most important thing LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) LDR is to automatically turn on a light at
 a certain light level.But in this project, we put the LDR on the screen of the laptop.
 When dark comes on LDR then LDR gets the signal to Arduino Analog Pin A0 then Arduino gives a single to digital pin 9 to activate the Servo.
 
 components which is required to make this project:
 1)Arduino UNO 
 2)SG 90 micro-server motor
 3)LDR of 5 ohms
 4)Register of 10K ohms
